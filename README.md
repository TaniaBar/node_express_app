# node_express_app

This is a simple exercise project to start using NodeJS. 
The project uses Express as the web framework and Nodemon for automatic server restarting during development and MySQL for database management.
## Installation

I did an npm init in the project directory and then I taped the command npm install to install project dependencies (ex. npm install express, npm install mysql).
To start the server I did an npm start.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into the following files and folders:

- index.js: the main file that starts the server and handles routes.
- connexion.js: the file for database connection.
- createTable.js: the file for creating database tables.
- routes.js: the file to define application routes.

This project focuses on restaurant management and its employees.
